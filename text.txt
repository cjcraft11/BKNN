 <p>Hi, I’m CJ Craft! My other persona... or should I say my Social Media persona is BrownKid. 
        I’m a Junior DevOps Engineer passionate about building, solving problems, and learning new things. 
       </p>
       <p>Currently, I’m diving deeper into full-stack web development and expanding my skillset across different areas of tech.       
        I like to experience everything and try to learn as much as possible from various fields. 
        I’m a big believer in the power of curiosity and the importance of continuous growth.</p> 
        <p>Here are a few things that make me who I am:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href=".travel.html">Traveling</a> to new places fuels my creativity and broadens my knowledge about other cultures and the world.</li>
        <li>Food is my love language, so always invite me. I like to try new foods all the time.</li>
        <li>My <a href=".dogs.html"> dogs</a> are my life. Do not get me started on them because I will talk your ear off.</li>
        <li>Setting <a href=".goals.html">goals</a> and challenging myself keeps me growing every day.</li>

BKNN is my personal space to share my journey, connect with like-minded people, and showcase the things that excite me. 
            Thanks for being part of this adventure!
